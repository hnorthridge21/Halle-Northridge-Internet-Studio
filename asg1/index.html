	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>The article "Evolution of the Web" talks about the evolution of the web from 1970-2018, going into detail on web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. 
		Web 1.0 lacked interactivity, you couldn't even upload images, and it was instead only informational. 
		<br>
		During web 2.0, the user interactivity was boosted, and became more focused on the users experience. 
		Blogs, images, videos and social media began to gain popularity during this time. 
		<br>
		During web 3.0, services and webpages began exchanging data and information more. This led to Ai and better connectivity.

		<br> <br>
		In the article, "The Wax and the Wane of the Web", they talk about the push for web standards. There was messy code with table layouts and there was no 
		"standard". They also used to have to use images for much of their styling needs like rounded corners or shapes diaplayed on a a page.
		<br>
		Now, it is much easier to create websites with more options and web standards like CSS and JavaScript are much more commonly supported. 
		The web contiunues to evolve and get better at a rapid pace.
