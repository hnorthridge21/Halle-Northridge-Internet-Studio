<h1>CatWoman</h1>
<h2>Hero or Villan?</h2>
<h3>Character Development</h3>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> was first debuted in spring of 1940 as "The Cat". Although she was first depicted as a supervillan and 
Batmans enemy, she has also been depicted as his love interest. She has become a sort of "anti-heroine" with a love-hate relationship with Batman. She is shown to 
follow a utilitarian moral philosophy, a sort of "robin hood" of the Batman universe. 

She was initially created with the idea of adding "sex-appeal" for the male gaze to the comics, but at the same time as a way to appeal more to female readers. 
They ended up creating a "friendly foe who committed crimes but was also a romantic interest in Batman's rather sterile life." She was meant to play a sort of cat and mouse
chase/game with Batman who wanted to reform her. However, she was different from the other Batman universe villans in that she was never a killer or down right "evil".
