    <h2>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h2>
    Sematic content communicates the information such as different sections, headings or lists rather than simply describing the information like structured content does. 
    Sematic content is meant to make it easier to navigate and understand for the user as well as search engines.

    Structured content is how the content is broken apart for data and searching. Structured content is less user focused and more for the actual browser. 

    <h2>How do they work together?</h2>

    Both sematic and structured content go together hand in hand to create an accessible page. Structured content provides the main content or outline while the sematic controls 
    how it is displayed on the page.

    <H2>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</H2>

    It is important to have both for user experience and accessibility. They helps users to both navigate the page and to find the information.
