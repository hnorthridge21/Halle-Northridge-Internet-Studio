        <h2>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h2>
        <p>I think the most efefctive approach for me would be to "Show Some Love". It reminds me of a technique I've used for overthinking. When an anxious thought vomes, I can say,
            "then what", or basically- yeah, it may happen, but then what? Even if it does happen, it will be okay, and it's not as big as I'm making it out to be. 
            Similar to the inner critic, I can say "then what"? My idea may not turn out as amazing as im thinking, but then what? I still didi it and I got the practice, 
            and I can continue to better myself.

        <h2>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h2>
        <p>In the scenario where he describes 3 classes, given 3 choices, I would have chosen to have 3 fixed deadlines. When I don't assign myself deadlines for my work, 
            I will procrastinate until the last day possible. Even when I have various projects due for various classes on the ssame day, I have to set a day to get each one done or 
            I will wait until the last day on all of them.

        <h2>Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as 
            the creator and publisher of your work?</h2>
        <p>In the book, he mentions how simply being able to create "usable interfaces to information on the web" puts you in a "position of power". 
            The power is limited since you can only edit and publish your own webpage, not others. Aditionally, the access to the information comes down to the user accessibility
            and networking, so you can control what you publish, but you can't always have full control over who will see it or interact with it.   </p>
