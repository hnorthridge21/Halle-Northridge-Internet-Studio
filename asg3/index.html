	<h1>Website Template</h1>
	<p>
From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious).
		An example of violation 6 I found when searching "bad website designs" was <a href="https://www.tagteamsigns.com/">Tag Team Signs</a> When visiting their site, I kept trying to click
		different elements only to realize they weren't clickable. There is so many various texts from bolded, to different colors, bulleted, and underlined. All of these can be used
		to tell a user that an element is clickable. However, NONE of these were clickable on this website. The most misleading part to me was the 'Our Services" section
		where it lists services they provide with little icons. I thought that I would be able to click the text or icons to bring me to a page with more information
		on these services, but I couldn't.
		
From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.
		Framing my project in a a story format can help me to consider the user experience when accessing my website. I can also think of their "journey" through my website from start to finish. With the homepage,
		the accessing of information or what they visited the site for, and leaving the site. I will need to consider the flow of various elements on my page to make their experience through the page from start to
		finish as smooth as possible. 
		
From Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography: What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) in typography design? Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy.
		Two ways way to create hierarchy in typography design is size and fonts. On a site like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">Wikipedia</a> with a fairly simple page layout, 
		they use different fonts, bolder fonts, and/or text size to differentiate between the titles, subheadings and different sections within the articles.
