	<h1>Monkey D. Dragon</h1>
	<p>I would choose
		<a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Monkey_D._Dragon">Monkey D. Dragon</a>
to be president because as the "supreme commander and founder of the Revolutionary Army (originally the Freedom Fighters)", he has a strong sense of justice, liberating oppressed nations and dismantling tyranny.

	<p>Monkey D. Dragon’s top campaign platform is about bringing freedom and equality to everyone. He believes that too many people live under unfair control, and he wants to change that by standing up

		to speak up for themselves and work together for change. His message is that true peace can only exist when all people are free.</p>
