    <p>
      When planning how I wanted my webpage to look, I decided I wanted it to have a sort of "cute" or "soft" aesthetic. It felt fitting since the location I chose is an island full of cats. I chose two similar fonts for 
      my page. I didn't want to have too many different fonts going on or risk the page looking too junky or busy. Instead, I chose to change the colors and size of text to incorporate hierarchy. Some of my text, the lists 
      for example, are left aligned while most of the paragraphs are center aligned. I decided to do this since the compact size of the list drew too much attention to the center of the page, making the rest feel very plain. 
      As I mentioned before, I wanted to go for a cute yet clean look. I chose to use a pink color palette, but by using cream and white, I feel like it helped to keep the pink from being too overpowering. 
      I made each of my buttons a bright pink square that expands as yoou hover over it, clearly identifying that it is clickable. I used this similar technique on my navigation bar where i have a white box appear and the text
      turns pink to identify that it is a clickable element. The hero image of cats surrounding visitors is welcoming and immediately puts intro perspective just how many cats there are here.
